## The dumplings

Ingredients list:

* 1.5 tsp Salt
* 1.5 tsp White pepper
* 2 cm Ginger (diced)
* 1 Fistful of Chinese Chives (diced)
* 1/5th or 1/6th of half of chinese Cabbage (diced)
* 2 tbsp Light Soy Sauce
* 3 tbsp Shaoxing Wine (optional)
* 1 tbsp of Sesame Oil
* Dumpling pastry/wrappers. The ones I use are 8cm in diameter, yields around 50 dumplings

Method:

1. Put pork mince in a bowl with the Salt, Pepper, Ginger, Chives, Cabbage, Soy, Shaoxing, Sesame Oil
**Tip:** As I haven't quite worked out the exact weight of cabbage to use, add the cabbage in portions while mixing, until you get a nice balance. I'm yet to do a proper weight measurement.
2. Mix well
3. Get a spoon and spoon out some mince and start packing your wrappers. But with enough room so you can fold the wrapper in half without much trouble
4. Dip your finger in some corn starch-y water and trace a semi-circle along the edge of the pastry

5. Fold it and seal the edges shut

6. You can curl the sides however you like. I personally make two curls on each side. Some people curl from one side to the other. Video to come.

7. (optional) I like to wrap a dumpling then cook it to test if further additions are required (eg. More soy, more pepper etc).
   _Cooking in boiled water, steam pot will take around 5 to 8 minutes_

## The soup
The soup I will cook separate to the dumplings and noodles. This just makes it easier to better manage flavours and time-keeping.

Ingredients List:
* 2 cups of chicken stock and 2 cups of water (1:1 ratio, but you can extend the water)
* 1 tsp of Garlic (minced)
* 1 tsp of Ginger (minced)
* 2 tbsp of Light Soy Sauce
* 1/2 to 1 tsp of Rice Wine Vinegar or Apple Cider vinegar
* 1 tsp of Sesame Oil
* 1 tbsp of Vegetable Oil
* 1 tsp Salt
* 1 tsp of White Pepper

Method:
1. In a pot on medium to high heat saute garlic and ginger with vegetable oil. 3 to 4 minutes.
2. Pour in the liquids, Salt and Pepper - the Rice Wine Vinegar last to manage it's
