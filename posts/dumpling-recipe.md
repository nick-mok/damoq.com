Ingredients list:

* 1.5 tsp Salt
* 1.5 tsp White pepper
* 2 cm Ginger (diced)
* 1 Fistful of Chinese Chives (diced)
* 1/5th or 1/6th of Chinese Cabbage (diced)
* 2 tbsp Light Soy 
* 3 tbsp Shaoxing Wine (optional)
* 1 tbsp of Sesame Oil
* Dumpling pastry/wrappers. The ones I use are 8cm in diameter, yields around 50 dumplings

Method:

1. Put pork mince in a bowl with the Salt, Pepper, Ginger, Chives, Cabbage, Soy, Shaoxing, Sesame Oil
2. Mix well
3. Get a spoon and spoon out some mince and start packing your wrappers. But with enough room so you can fold the wrapper in half without much trouble
4. Dip your finger in some corn starch-y water and trace a semi-circle along the edge of the pastry

5. Fold it and seal the edges shut

6. You can curl the sides however you like. I personally make two curls on each side. Some people curl from one side to the other. Video to come.

7. (optional) I like to wrap a dumpling then cook it to test if further additions are required (eg. More soy, more pepper etc).
   _Cooking in boiled water, steam pot will take around 3 to 4 minutes_
