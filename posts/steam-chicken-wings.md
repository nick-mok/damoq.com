11. Pull the dish out and let it rest for 3 mins or
12. Enjoy the juiciest chicken in the world

## Serving

You can serve the chicken on boiled Rice and Boy Choy (1 min) or Broccolini (2 mins). \
Splash your veggies and rice with the delicious juices from your cook up. But you can serve this with anything else or just have it around as a delicious protein snack :) \
\
Most importantly, eat this immediately and try not to gag on the bones.

## Ideas

A splash of sesame oil make this delicious\
1 x Birds eye chill or even the mild big chilli sliced julienne goes really well with this
