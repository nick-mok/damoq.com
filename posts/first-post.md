I'm Nick and this is just my little corner on the internet. I'm a web developer currently expanding my skills in frontend development, hopefully with some fun projects to share soon.

#### I may blog often, or not at all...
Currently this space is primarily for me and to track my journey. 

Other than fiddling in JS my other interests are movies, music and games, there's bound to be some mention of that somewhere!
